# Meal Planner
This project was created for a hackathon

The purpose of this project is to do the following:
- Show different meal plans that are available on ECU's campus
- Let the user enter their type of meal plan and how many meals/bucks they have left. Through this, the program will output whether the rate at which the user is using their meal plan is too fast or too slow.
  - If the user is going too slow, then the program will output how many meals/bucks the user should use per day to finish by the end of the semester
  - If the user is going too fast, then the program will output how many meals/bucks the user should finish per day in order to not run out by the end of the semester
